# Projects

### Quantifying Morphologic Phenotypes in Prostate Cancer - Developing Topological Descriptors for Machine Learning Algorithms (QuBBD)

The long-term goal of this project is to develop quantitative methodology for detecting geometric and topological features in point clouds extracted from (histology) images. Of particular relevance, this project considers the setting of prostate cancer classification, which is based on a pathologist grading of histology slides using the Gleason grading system. These pathology slides are a source of biomedical big data that are increasingly available as archived material. Developing these quantitative methods will be a significant advance towards a (semi-)automated quantification of prostate cancer aggressiveness. This award supports an interdisciplinary team of investigators in computational mathematics, computer science, biomedical engineering, and pathology to develop mathematical and computational tools based on topological descriptors and machine learning in order to distinguish between different morphological types of prostate cancer.

### Computer Science through Storytelling

Our team is developing and researching culturally responsive curriculum and teacher development that engage American Indian and rural Montana students in learning computer science and computing skills. Instead of creating a new stand-alone curriculum (and new standards for teachers to meet), the project infuses computer science across the grades 4-8 curriculum, which helps students understand that computing skills are relevant across disciplines and are important for a wide variety of professions in the work-force. Through a research practice partnership, this project is working directly with the Montana Office of Public Instruction, tribal entities, teachers, and other stakeholders to develop these culturally responsive resources, which will be aligned with the new Computer Science state content area standards and with Montana's Indian Education for All curriculum.
