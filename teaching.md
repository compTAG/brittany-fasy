## Teaching Statement

As my research is in the intersection of Mathematics and Computer Science, the classes that I enjoy teaching are also in this intersection; 
for example, Discrete Matheatics, Computational Topology, and Computational Geometry. 
In these courses, there is a process that the students must learn. 
Students can memorize particular examples, but they cannot solve new problems unless they have learned the process of how to solve the problems. 
My teaching style emphasizes that the material should be understood, not memorized.
