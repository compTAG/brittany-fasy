> After growing up in Philadelphia, I attended Saint Joseph's University, where I earned a B.S. in Mathematics and in Computer Science. 
> At SJU, I lived with [Kathleen Vaccaro](http://www.kathleenvaccaro.com/) for four years. She now has an MFA from Pratt!
> 
> I earned my PhD in Computer Science from Duke University. 
> In my second year of graduate school, my adviser ([Herbert Edelsbrunner](http://pub.ist.ac.at/~edels/)) told me he was offered a position at IST Austria. 
> So, our research group moved to Klosterneubug, Austria (near Vienna), and I lived (mostly) in Austria for three years.
> 
> After earning my PhD, I was a postdoc for three years: one year at CMU and two years at Tulane University. 
> At CMU, I started collaborating with statisticians. 
> At Tulane University, I worked with [Carola Wenk](http://www.cs.tulane.edu/~carola/) on topological approaches to road network construction and comparison.
> 
> Now, I am an Associate Professor at Montana State University.
> 
> In my spare time, I love to run and to play lacrosse. 
> I even played with the [Vienna Cherokees](https://www.cherokees-lacrosse.com/) in Austria!
